        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a third-year Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering
          student at Vishwakarma Institute Of Technology, Pune, with a strong
          foundation in Core Java, MySQL, and Machine Learning. My academic
          journey has been marked by a deep interest in game development and
          automation, leading me to spearhead various projects and initiatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I serve as the Level Designing and Ideation Head at the
          Game Development Club, where I orchestrate the creation of immersive
          and engaging game levels. Additionally, I have developed a project
          titled 'Next-Gen Gesture-Adapted Control System for Users with
          Disabilities,' which focuses on creating an innovative system that
          allows handless users to control the cursor via facial gestures and
          voice commands.
        </p>
        <p>
          My passion for technology and innovation drives me to continuously
          expand my skill set and take on new challenges. I am enthusiastic
          about pursuing a career as a software engineer, where I can leverage
          my technical expertise and creative problem-solving abilities to make
          impactful contributions.
